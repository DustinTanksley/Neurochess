I have included my debugging GUI, along with a script to automatically compile and run.

The Graphics do not belong to me, and I have no claim to the artwork, they were simply for visualization purposes. 

I have also included AI.java, which is the code that ran on tournment servers. It has several things implemented that
my debugging program does not, such as time controls, as I have no time controls on my offline program. All these methods
simply return a default boolean to allow the program to ignore these parts.

The explaination of program document I have included lists generally the purpose of most of my functions, in the order they were
implemented.

Finally, I have included a .jar file that will run standalone, without any additional work.
